## Strategic Identity

### Program Name
**Workforce Deployment Program** (internally may reference "WDP")

### Core Mission
Build, deploy, and scale certified professional capacity infrastructure across 20 industry sectors through a standardized, outcome-priced workforce monetization model.

### Strategic Positioning
We are not a sales training program. We are a **workforce capacity deployment system** that monetizes professional credentials aligned to real job outcomes and market demand.

### Value Proposition
Participants don't "sell courses" — they **deploy outcome-priced professional pathways** that directly correlate to executive and specialist roles paying $80,000–$800,000 USD/year.

---

## Final Strategic Guidance

### The North Star Principle
**Every decision, every word, every action must answer:**  
> "Does this position us as workforce infrastructure builders — or as salespeople?"

If the answer is salespeople, **reject it.**

### Gatekeeping Quality
- Turn away 70% of applicants if needed
- One high-caliber Workforce Deployment Specialist > 10 opportunists
- Cohort quality determines long-term success

### Language Discipline
- Internal team uses "deploy," "build," "scale" — NEVER "sell"
- External materials use "Workforce Deployment Program" — NEVER "Sales Program"
- Flyers, emails, calls: zero transactional language

### Long-Term Vision
This is not a 2026 project. This is the **foundation of BTH's global workforce infrastructure** for the next decade.

Build accordingly.
