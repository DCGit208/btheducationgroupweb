Community Development Programme Partnerships

Introduction

Alongside our core trade‑school programmes, BTH Education Group aims to cultivate a sustainable ecosystem of investment and sponsorship that ensures communities across Africa have the tools, infrastructure and scholarships they need.  Rural and peri‑urban villages often lack access to energy, water, healthcare and training; vocational programmes and community partnerships bridge these gaps and create jobs ￼ ￼.  To deliver on this mandate, we invite two types of partners:
	•	Investors – mission‑driven individuals and organisations who fund the equipment and resources required to run sector‑specific programmes.  Instead of a one‑off donation, investors lease assets to our training centres and earn residual returns through rental fees.
	•	Sponsors – philanthropists and community advocates who cover course fees for groups of learners.  Their contributions provide scholarships, training materials and mentorship across sectors.

The sections below outline the critical sectors, the trades taught and the partnership opportunities available.

Sponsor drone‑pilot training and UAV maintenance courses.

Investor Programme

Investors play a vital role in creating lasting infrastructure for our training programmes.  Instead of a one‑time donation, investors fund or lease the assets required in a sector.  Each investment package can include the capital items listed above plus installation and training for local staff.  Investors then earn revenue through rental or service agreements with the training centres.  Examples of investment models:
	1.	Equipment leasing – the investor purchases assets (e.g., solar panels, sewing machines or drones) and leases them to the training centre.  Lease payments are drawn from course fees and usage fees.  Investors retain ownership and receive a share of revenue over a 3‑ to 5‑year term.
	2.	Service concessions – investors finance infrastructure like mini‑grids or water systems and operate them under a concession, receiving income from user fees while committing to provide discounted services for students and cooperatives.
	3.	Revenue‑sharing partnerships – investors co‑fund the establishment of new sectors (e.g., a bio‑lab or manufacturing workshop) in exchange for a percentage of training revenues.

Investment returns are not based on the sale of equipment but on its utilisation.  Training centres rent the technology to learners and cooperatives; investors benefit from stable, long‑term usage while enabling community growth.  Opportunities exist in every sector—from Starlink terminals for connectivity to irrigation pumps for farming—and we tailor packages to match investor preferences.

Sponsorship Programme

While investors fund equipment, sponsors directly support people.  Course fees average 100,000 FCFA per learner (roughly $170 USD).  Sponsorship packages multiply impact:
	•	Bronze package: Train 10 learners (~$1,700 USD).  Covers tuition, materials and mentorship for a small cohort.  Suitable for individuals, families or small businesses.
	•	Silver package: Train 50 learners (~$8,500 USD).  Provides equipment and instruction for a classroom of future technicians or artisans.
	•	Gold package: Train 100 learners (~$17,000 USD).  Funds an entire cohort in one sector, with the option to support cross‑sector projects (e.g., combining agriculture and renewable energy).

Sponsors may choose which sector to support.  All contributions fund scholarships, course materials and instructor stipends.  Sponsors receive periodic reports, invitations to virtual graduation ceremonies and recognition on our community wall.  By combining investor and sponsor programmes, we can ensure that communities have the equipment, infrastructure and financing needed to thrive.

Conclusion

Rural and peri‑urban communities deserve access to high‑quality vocational training and the infrastructure to sustain it.  Through investor partnerships and sponsorship packages, your contributions become catalysts for change.  Whether funding solar panels and mini‑grids or sponsoring a cohort of aspiring health workers, your support creates jobs, reduces poverty and empowers communities across Africa.
