## Questions for Your Review:

### **Content Clarifications Needed:**
1. **Personal Development Map:** Should I create a visual representation of the 4 key areas, or do you have specific imagery? <!-- I have imagery: personal-development-map.jpg in the content-materials folder in the root -->
2. **Career Area Examples:** Should I reference the career-area-examples.jpg content specifically, or create comprehensive lists? <!-- I need a comprehensive list; use service-offer-document.pdf in the content-materials folder as a reference for a comprehensive list and supplement where needed -->
3. **Pricing Display:** How prominently should we display the FCFA pricing? Should we include USD conversions? <!-- USE USD as Main pricing currency and include FCFA conversion -->
4. **Service Offer Document:** Should I create industry lists based on the attached documentation, or reference it generally? <!-- This document is very exhaustive, so use it and suplement where needed -->

### **Priority Adjustments:**
1. **HEXAD vs AWIS Balance:** Should HEXAD be the primary focus with AWIS as corporate supplement, or equal emphasis? <!-- Equal Emphasis: the page already has AWIS, So Add HEXAD; We're selling the two models in workforce development and building-->
2. **Individual vs Corporate:** Which enrollment pathway should be more prominent in the design? <!-- Based on each models content, Corporate will be prominent in the AWIS Model which already exist and you can build from what is already there; meanwhile the Hexad is workforce building at the level of individuals in a journeyman training fashion -->
3. **Industry Coverage:** Should we highlight specific industries or present comprehensive coverage equally? <!-- our service offer document already indicates that, and the small supplement of the career-area-examples.jpg - we need comprehensive coverage, to make us the Netflix of Workforce Development, you can use the references to set chronology  -->
4. **Certification Integration:** How prominently should we feature the certification pricing structure? <!-- based on the model at hand-->
