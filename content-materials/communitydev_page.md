Community Development Trade School Programs

Empowering rural and peri‑urban communities across Africa requires more than access to capital – it demands practical skills and reliable connectivity.  The following community‑development trade programmes are designed to build self‑sufficiency, create local employment and ensure that even communities cut off from urban support can prosper.  Each programme corresponds to a major sector of community life and prepares learners to work within that sector.  A dedicated LMS (Learning Management System) will host courses for each programme, and an ISP Service (e.g., Starlink) ensures that even remote villages can access training and collaborate across borders.
