## 🛠️ DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY

### Standard Sector Page Template (Based on IT Page Success)

#### 1. **Page Structure** (Replicate informationtechnology.html)
```
├── Hero Section
├── Framework Selection (Professional Dev vs HEXAD)
├── Level Selector (1-5)
├── Vendor/Category Filters
├── Certification Cards with:
│   ├── Vendor Logo
│   ├── Certification Name
│   ├── Level Badge
│   ├── Exam Info
│   ├── Pricing
│   └── "Add to Cart" CTA
├── Professional Development Modules (per level)
└── Checkout Integration
```

#### 2. **Data Requirements**
For each new sector, create JSON data file:
```json
{
  "sector": "Human Resources Technology",
  "certifications": [
    {
      "name": "Workday HCM Certification",
      "vendor": "Workday",
      "level": 2,
      "level_range": [2, 5],
      "category": "HRIS",
      "focus": "Human Capital Management",
      "exam": "Workday HCM Fundamentals",
      "tags": ["hris", "talent-management"],
      "vendor_stage": "Associate",
      "price": 450,
      "logo": "assets/images/vendor-logos/workday.svg"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 3. **Professional Development Modules**
- **Copy from IT page:** All 5 levels (L1: 12 modules, L2: 15, L3: 18, L4: 22, L5: 28)
- **Customize descriptions** to sector-specific leadership contexts
- **Keep hour allocations** consistent across sectors

#### 4. **Filtering Logic**
```javascript
// Copy exact filtering from informationtechnology.html
const inLevelWindow = (cert) => {
    if (!Array.isArray(cert.level_range) || cert.level_range.length !== 2) {
        return cert.level === level; // Exact match fallback
    }
    const [minL] = cert.level_range;
    return level >= minL; // Cumulative visibility
};
```

#### 5. **Vendor Logo Assets**
Create vendor logos for each new sector:
```
assets/images/vendor-logos/
├── workday.svg
├── sap.svg
├── fema.svg
├── nfpa.svg
├── shopify.svg
├── magento.svg
... etc
```

## 💰 ESTIMATED RESOURCE ALLOCATION

### Time Investment
- **Phase 1 (4 sectors):** 8 weeks × 1 developer = 320 hours
- **Phase 2 (5 sectors):** 8.5 weeks × 1 developer = 340 hours
- **Phase 3 (3 sectors):** 4.5 weeks × 1 developer = 180 hours
- **Total:** 21 weeks = **840 development hours**

### Cost Considerations
- **Developer Time:** 840 hours @ $75/hr = $63,000
- **Certification Research:** 12 sectors @ $500 = $6,000
- **Vendor Logos/Assets:** 50 logos @ $20 = $1,000
- **QA Testing:** 100 hours @ $50/hr = $5,000
- **Total Budget:** **~$75,000**

### Alternative: Phased MVP Approach
- **Quick-Launch Strategy:** Build simplified pages without full filtering
- **Phase 1 MVP:** Static certification lists (4 weeks instead of 8)
- **Phase 2 Enhancement:** Add filtering/HEXAD integration later
- **Budget Savings:** ~50% ($37,500 instead of $75,000)
