## 17. Implementation Checkpoints
Before this page is considered “complete,” verify:

- [ ] Levels 1–5 are clearly defined and visible on page.
- [ ] Role tracks correctly map into Certification Explorer filters.
- [ ] Domains, vendors and certifications are populated in the underlying data model.
- [ ] PD bundles appear both in the global PD section and within relevant certification cards.
- [ ] Employer CTAs are wired to correct forms/pages.
- [ ] Accessibility checks (keyboard, screen reader, contrast) pass basic audits.

On approval: use this outline as the master spec to expand `manufacturing.html` and integrate with the global `certifications.json` / JS dataset.
